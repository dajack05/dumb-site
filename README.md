# Dumb Site

## What the heck is this?

A really bad idea!

I just had an idea. It *feels* like you should be able to configure and write a basic website with just Markdown and the like.

So I made this.

It sucks...

Don't use it...

## What's with all the files and folders?

- `site.toml` - The file that holds all the site-wide configuration data.
- `/lib` - Where the libraries I use live.
- `/pages` - Each Markdown file will be it's own page.

## How do I deploy a site?

You shouldn't.

But if you must...

Just copy/paste everything into the root folder of a server which can run PHP.
